SMS2PC Android
===========

Requires Android 4.0.3 or newer. Project from Android Studio v2.3.1.

## Installation
Copy the files into a directory, and open the project from Studio.

Open ./app/src/main/java/com/milankragujevic/sms2pc/SMSApp.java and change the API key (currently gJBXV6vBOd) to something unique to your application, and also change that in the web component so the two components can communicate successfully. 

## Web Component
Find the web component [here](https://github.com/milankragujevic/sms2pc_web).
